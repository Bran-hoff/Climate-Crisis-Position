# GeoHealth Policy & Learning Resources

## What is a GeoHealth Policy? 
#### Work in Progress Definitions:

To qualify as a GeoHealth Policy or GeoHealth-informed decision, an educational or research products or resources used to substantiate the policy position or decision must address the following issues: geo-scalability, info-scalability, and socio-scalability. 

**Geo-scalability**: geographic scaling for global, community, and individual usability for decisions and communication.

**Info-scalability**: communication strategies aligned with FAIR standards (findable,accessible, inclusive, reproducible/scalable/customizable) across one or more geoscience disciplines and one or more health disciplines (trans-science; trans-technology; trans-language) researching processes or mechanisms linked to human health impacts, education and/or mortality.

**Socio-scalability**: attention to experimental and product design for inclusion of The Edge, where the most vulnerable communities and individuals are known to have the highest risk of impacts based on earth observations, monitoring data and research studies.  

Christina's examplea of a personal GeoHealth Policy: At the bottom of the Suicide Prevention resource I have listed example research and resources from within the past two years, that are specific to mental health. AND, it's notable that this work enlightened me to the Community Readiness Model, which I am now integrating for use in my CyberTraining and RAPID disaster research specific to hurricanes and climate change.   This is a meta-meta example of how geoscientists can learn from mental health science, brought to Geo-Sections by the GeoHealth Section.   I have a personal work policy of allowing my work contributions to scale from championing a mental health Town Hall at AGU Fall Meeting (insprired by my individual community) in my role on the GeoHealth Section Leadership Team (my service community), and by leading a RAPID response poster session online for disaster researchers (my cybertraining education community) contributing to hurricane response with data science and cyberinfrastructure tools from biomedical informatics and hydroinformatics (my global research community) with methods including a Call for a GeoHealth Protest during data science cybertraining (my education community).  

## Proposal for a AGU Fall Meeting Town Hall on Mental Health: 
When any AGU member is disrupted or unable to contribute to education and research, we can expect global ripple effects of scientific progress linked to the growth or decline of institutional and physical process understanding within research communities and public knowledge systems, about earth and environmental systems on which human health and society depend. 

### Questions to Explore while ensuring 'GeoHealth' policy alignment: 

How do we normalize geohealthy* culture shifts that support learning environments, educators and researchers?  

How do we address normal and trauma-informed levels of discomfort to operationalize the use of new tools and geohealth resources*?  

What can I do today to educate myself and others about integrating existing geohealth resources* into my work process?  

* Resources - in this definition, 'Geohealth Resources' should scale global, community, and individual resources as per definitions above and related to a communityt process for determining consensus on position statements, building on Rehr et al 2020 and GeoHealth Section leadership ideas in progress. 

# Climate Change Position Statement & Learning Resources 
From April 29, 2019 to December 31, 2021, we will be compiling comments on the current AGU Climate Change Position Statement based on the article "A GeoHealth Response to a Geoscience Community Climate Change Position Statement" (Rehr et al., GeoHealth, 2020; submitted) and the GeoHealth Section Comments ([link to 2019.10.12 GeoHealth Comments Integrated in AGU Position Statement](https://github.com/waterhackweek/Climate-Change-Position/blob/master/AGU2019ClimateChangePositionStatement_GeoHealthComments_20191010.pdf).  This is a review version for additional commenting on GeoHealth Section edits Submitted by Aubrey Miller (President) and Claire Horwell (President-Elect) on behalf of the GeoHealth Section Leadership (October 11, 2019). AGU commenting period ends 2019.10.13.

## How to Contribute Comments and Learning Resources
This repository is intended for use developing educational information, including links to resources which support additional comment on the AGU Climate Change Position Statement.   It is being hosted by the Waterhackweek community as an educational service through 2020. Please visit our [How to Contribute](link needs to be developed) page for more details. 

To access the current AGU Climate Change Position Statement, visit the AGU website at [Position Climate](https://www.agu.org/Share-and-Advocate/Share/Policymakers/Position-Statements/Position_Climate).  A position statement on climate change was previously adopted by the American Geophysical Union in December 1998; A new version was adopted December 2003; Revised and Reaffirmed December 2007, February 2012, August 2013, November 2019.  

To learn more about the AGU Position Statement comment process, see [this EOS article (AGU, 2019)](https://eos.org/agu-news/agu-position-statements-now-open-for-member-comment) and AGU resources on Climate Change including the [Fact Sheet on Climate Change](https://www.agu.org/Share-and-Advocate/Share/Policymakers/Position-Statements/Fact-Sheet-Climate-change). 

To learn more about AGU’s GeoHealth Section, visit us on [GeoHealth AGU Connect](https://connect.agu.org/geohealth/home) and follow us on Twitter: @AguGeohealth. The community is invited to share and discuss comments about the position statements with us [here:](https://github.com/waterhackweek/Climate-Change-Position)
